						<h2>About the Project</h2>
						
						<p class="lead">A project at the HGK Basel, Switzerland. <br>
						Supervising professors: Ted Davis, Viola Diehl.<p>
						
						<p>The starting point of this project was the word "ran", the japanese expression for "chaos". <br>
						Being free to chose in which way to approach this project, I took the oppurtiunity to finally have a look at processing and with it the possibilies I have to use my programming skills when creating visuals and design.</p>
						
						<h4>Lorenz Visualization 1+2</h4>
						<p>While researching about "chaos" I quickly stumbled upon the mathematical chaos theory and its formulas that would generate pretty amazing shapes. I choose this to be my first challenge in processing and started visualizing the so called "Lorenz 84 Attractor".</p>
						
						<h4>Sound Experiments</h4>
						<p>Having these forms and therefore my first success with processing, I chose to now use these formes to test some other possibilities of processing in this case working with the minim library and sound.</p>
						
						<h4>pcaRan</h4>
						<p>Finally, having managed basic visualizations with code and the use of libraries in processing, I started thinking about bringing it all together. Means, nice visuals with user interaction and some relation to the chaos theory where all the visuals came from in the first place.</p>
						
						<h4>pcaCollisionDetection</h4>
						<p>While building "pcaRan" I had to deal with pretty heavy collision detection (6000+ points colliding with each other each frame. This means, the worst case would be 6000! (= &infin;) collision tests per frame). To make this run as smoothly as it gets I developed a pretty fast collision detection algorythm which, after it has proven itself in "pcaRan", I extracted into a new processing library.</p>
						
						<p>After building "pcaCollisionDetection", I rewrote some parts of "pcaRan" to make it work with my own new library.</p>
						
						<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
						<p>This project has been developed in processing and is therefore optimized to be viewed in the processing environment.</p>
						<p>What you can see on this very page is a small part of "pcaRan" running in processingJS. Notice the great performance when calculating 300 points. "pcaRan" uses 6000+ points.<br>
						So all the other sketches that are displayed on this website are running as java-applet inside the browser. Sound doesn't get through to the applet in browsers.</p>
						<p>To see the sketches as they're meant to be, download the newest version of the code from github and run it with processing localy on your computer.</p>
